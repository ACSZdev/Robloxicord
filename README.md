# Robloxicord
Discord-Roblox extension to quickly help users link their Roblox account with stuff such as Ro-Verify, Bloxlink, and other. Need an explanation? This starts a login process through a background process emulator that joins the game, and then stops and copies the code to your clipboard. This is still in the works but I intend to get it done.
